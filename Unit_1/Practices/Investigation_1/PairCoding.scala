Introduction

Git is an open source version specific control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

Specifically, Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire code base and its history 
are available on every developer's computer, allowing easy access to branching and merging.

GitHub is a non-profit company that offers a hosting service for repositories stored in the cloud. Essentially, it makes it 
easier for individuals and teams to use Git as the control and collaboration version. The GitHub interface is fairly easy to 
use for the novice developer who wants to take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more tech savvy and command line usage.

Developing

The activities to be followed in practice were:

1. Create an account on github.com if you don't have one, if you already have one then we're fine

 
2. Configure your github account with SHH key, so as not to put our username and password every time
 

3. Create a new repository called pratica_git_flow

 


4. Create a default README.md

 

5. Clone our PC


 

6. Create a branch called development and make this branch the main one, this means that it will not be master
 

 


7. Make a change in the development branch in the README.md file could be "This is the development branch"
 


8. Make a commit in the development branch
 


9. Push the development branch
 
10. Create a branch called features

 
11. Make a change in the features branch in the README.md file can be "This is the features branch"

 

conclusion

It is the first time that I use the Git Hub tool, so I had to watch some videos to know how it worked,
 as well as making a mistake when creating the SSH key and its respective passwords, however, I think it's all a matter of practice,
  to be able to memorize the commands and thus everything is easier
