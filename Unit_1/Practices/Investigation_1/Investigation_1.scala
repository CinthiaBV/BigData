Pair Programming

Developing new software is not an easy process. Depending on the size of the program, a large number of 
potential junctures, roles, and problematic issues will need to be considered. Even the most expert software 
developers can become disoriented. Hence, in recent years other more modern working methods have been developed 
that allow more efficient programming and generate error-free code: Scrum and Kanban serve, for example, to improve
 the complete system.
Pair programming doesn't try to be all that encompassing: developers always work in pairs on code. How does it 
work and what are the advantages of this working method?
What is pair programming?

The method known as pair programming (in Spanish, pair programming) is used mainly in agile software development and,
 more specifically, in extreme programming (XP). Pair programming specifies that there are always two people working 
 on the code at the same time, and that they sit together as much as possible. One is in charge of writing the code
  and the other of supervising it in real time. At the same time, they are constantly exchanging impressions: they 
  discuss problems, find solutions and develop creative ideas.
  Typically, these two workers are assigned different roles: the programmer who has been assigned the pilot role is 
  responsible for writing the code. The programmer who has been assigned the copilot role supervises that code. One of 
  the rules of pair programming states that these two roles are exchanged regularly (at short intervals). In this way, 
  a possible hierarchical gap is avoided: equality between both workers is promoted and a fluid exchange of roles is achieved.
In addition, ideally, the workspace is also tailored to the specific requirements of pair programming. Each worker must have 
their own mouse, keyboard and screen, which will always show the same information as the colleague's.
Somewhat less common is the method called remote pair programming. In this case, the programmers do not sit together, but are 
located in completely different places. For this method to work, you must have special technical solutions. Even despite the distance,
 colleagues must have a direct line of communication and must be able to access the code and view modifications in real time.
Practice in pair programming

In practice, this is usually a collaboration between two developers with different degrees of experience: thus, a more experienced worker
 can pass on their
knowledge to your younger peers directly through practice. For their part, a younger worker may come up with other, perhaps more innovative
 ideas that they can contribute to the project.
Likewise, a combination of workers from different industries can also be quite beneficial: if an old-school programmer collaborates with a designer, 
the combination of their experiences can be quite helpful for both.
The working method is very useful mainly for large projects. The “four eyes” principle is especially effective when you have to deal with large
 amounts of code, which also needs to be changed regularly. It guarantees that the best possible version of a fragment will always be inserted 
 in the source text, reducing the amount of errors, so that it will not be necessary to make so many retouching afterwards. Post-monitoring of 
 very long source codes requires investing too much time and effort, so it is best if these codes are established without errors from the
  beginning as far as possible.
However, it is not always mandatory that this collaboration is between the same colleagues, even in the case of the same project. In fact, 
it can be beneficial to mix these pairs regularly. This way, all team members can get a good idea of ​​the full source text. This allows the 
success of the project not to depend so much on the different people involved. If one of them fails, it does not jeopardize the entire project, 
since the rest can compensate for its absence.
Advantages and disadvantages of pair programming

Working as a couple in the framework of a project, whether it is scheduling or other procedures, has many advantages. In general, four eyes see much more
 than just two - the pair programming method minimizes the risk of errors. While one person writes the code, the other visualizes it and concentrates only
  on finding errors. In general, it is quite difficult for us to detect the errors themselves. It is usually our colleagues who detect them most quickly.
Another of the great advantages derived from communication is the constant development of creativity: the constant exchange that takes place between the pair
 of programmers causes ideas that perhaps would not be had if the work were individual. Intercom also ensures that problems can be better solved in less time.
  Well, while a person who works alone may feel satisfied with the first option that seems best to him, the people involved in pair programming must always
   justify their decisions to the rest. It is possible that they have another perception of the problem and are not satisfied with the solution that is proposed 
   to them. This generates a debate in which new ideas are often presented that lead to a much better code.

   Good code is also concise code: experience dictates that source text generated by pair programming tends to be shorter in layout and therefore more efficient. 
   This allows a later saving in resources in case of maintenance and adaptation.
As we have already mentioned, this technique can also be used to allow more experienced workers to share their knowledge with their younger colleagues. In this way, 
you not only take advantage of the essential advantage of pair programming, which is the generation of high-quality code, but it can also be used simultaneously for 
training purposes.
However, this is all very time consuming: two programmers work together much faster than one alone, but no more than two programmers working separately. This means 
that this method makes projects progress more slowly or requires more staff, which in turn increases costs. Supporters of pair programming estimate that these overtime
 hours are compensated because the generated code contains fewer errors, is better structured in general and requires much less maintenance.
Another possible downside is that pair programming is suitable for team building, but only if both partners work well together. With such a close collaboration, their 
problems with each other may slow down the results or end up escalating to something much worse. It is for this reason that the assignment of pairs in this method cannot
 be done randomly. The ideal would be to work with a different partner each time, but this only works well if there is harmony in the whole team.

 What are the benefits of this approach?

Greater discipline: The presence of observing prevents the driver from being distracted from his tasks and forces him to do things well.
Greater motivation: Programming in pairs is more enjoyable than programming alone, being an important motivation for the work team.
Increased long-term productivity: According to one study, pair programming increases development time by 15%, but in return provides more quality in design, reduces 
defects and improves communication between team members.
Better learning: The driver can be accompanied by an observer more experienced than him, or vice versa. They are even likely to have a similar skill level in different 
fields. As a result, at least one of you will learn the best way: watching an expert work.
Risk reduction: As the code will be subject to constant review, the risk of making mistakes that take us away from the desired solution will be reduced.
